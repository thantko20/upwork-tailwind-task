                If you’re looking to kickstart your fitness journey, lose weight
                or run your first marathon next year, there’s nothing like a
                good online workout program to help you meet your goal. They’re
                a fantastic solution if you can’t fit regular trips to the gym

                than gym memberships.

                Future, a virtual workout app, pairs you with a personal coach
                to increase your chances of meeting your fitness goals. When you
                sign up, you will select your coach and meet with them via a
                Facetime call. Your coach will create customized weekly workout
                plans, send daily messages and get on phone calls to help keep
                you motivated and ensure you get the most out of your workouts.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's that daily interaction with your coach that sets{" "}
                <strong>Future</strong> apart from other online workout
                programs. The communication helps to keep you accountable, and
                your coach will determine your workout plans to help you achieve
                your goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Future app syncs with the Apple Watch, so your coach can
                review biometric details including your heart rate and calories
                burned during each workout. They can also use that information
                to tailor your workouts to ensure that you're making consistent
                progress. The app itself is simple, intuitive and easy to use.

                Future offers impressive customization options and is designed

                training plans that work with your schedule, goals and available
                workout equipment, and personalized audio guides you through
                each workout. If you're going to be traveling, you can inform
                your coach and they will modify your training plan to fit your
                travel plans, making it easier to keep up with your workouts.
                There is no limit to the number of workouts you complete each

                Your personal coach provides valuable support, and the
                subscription fee reflects that. Future memberships cost $149 per

              <h2>How to Choose the Best Online Workout Program for You</h2>
              <p>
                As you explore the best online workout programs that we’ve
                highlighted above, it’s important to choose a program that’s
                also the best fit for you. Thinking about the following
                qualities can help you to narrow down your choices and find the
                program that you will not only enjoy, but that will also help
                you to get the results you’re looking for.
              </p>
              <h3>Cost</h3>
              <p>
                Consider how much you can comfortably spend per month on a
                workout program, and don’t forget to budget in any equipment
                purchases that you will need to make. Keep in mind that many
                programs offer discounts if you purchase a quarterly or annual
                subscription.
              </p>
              <h3>Fitness Goals</h3>
              <p>
                Defining your fitness goals can help you to determine the types
                of classes and programs you need. Think about whether you’re
                looking to build muscle, lose weight, run a marathon or achieve
                another specific goal. Look for a program that offers a variety
                of workouts for your fitness level, whether you’re looking for
                low-impact exercises or high-intensity workouts.
              </p>
              <h3>Live or On-Demand Classes</h3>
              <p>
                The ability to attend live workouts can be a major motivational
                factor, and it can help to keep you excited about your fitness
                journey. Live workouts also change up your workout routine and
                can provide a chance to connect with others, which is important
                if you’re working out at home. Some online workout programs
                offer live workouts, but others don't, so you need to consider
                how important these classes are to you.{" "}
              </p>
              <h3>Accessibility Options</h3>
              <p>
                Consider what type of accessible environment is best for you. If
                you often use a certain device, like your phone or computer,
                make sure you can access the workout program on your device. You
                will also want to think about how the program is structured. For
                example, do you want the freedom to pick and choose your
                workouts from all of the available videos, or would you rather
                have the guidance of a structured program that picks your
                workouts for you?
              </p>
              <h3>Required Equipment</h3>
              <p>
                If you’re considering enrolling in a program, make sure that you
                have—or can get—the type of equipment required. Many programs
                offer workouts that require no equipment at all, while others
                might require some basics or even more expensive equipment like
                dumbbells, kettlebells, treadmills and ellipticals.
              </p>
              <h3>Add-Ons</h3>
              <p>
                Think about whether you want a program that offers any specific
                add-ons. These include options like meal plans and nutrition
                plans, community groups and even one-on-one support from a
                personal trainer.
              </p>

              <h2>FAQs</h2>

              <h3>
                What do I need to get started using an online workout program?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Many online workout programs allow you to get started with
                minimal fitness equipment. That equipment might be as simple as
                a yoga mat, resistance bands or hand weights, and there are many
                fitness classes that require no equipment at all. You may also
                need a way of streaming live classes, such as through a
                smartphone or tablet, or you might just need to be able to log
                onto the platform and log your workouts. Some apps integrate
                with an Apple Watch or other wearable, which allows for enhanced
                biometric tracking.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Are online workout programs as effective as in-person classes?
              </h3>
              <p>
                You can get the same value from online workout programs as from
                in-person classes, depending on your motivation. Online programs
                are often more affordable and accessible than in-person classes,
                so you may be able to work out more consistently. However,
                there’s less accountability with an online workout program, so
                it’s easier to start skipping workouts than if you’re attending
                a live class that follows a specific schedule.
              </p>
              <h3>
                Which online workout program is the best for weight loss? The
                best online workout program for weight loss really depends on
                how you prefer to work out.
              </h3>
              <p>
                Daily Burn features a weight tracker and Aaptiv offers a weight
                loss program, but the most effective program will be one that
                keeps you motivated and excited about losing weight and getting
                fit.
              </p>
              <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
              <p>
                Whether you can’t make it to the gym or don’t have the budget to
                hire a certified personal trainer, these online workout programs
                can help you to still achieve your fitness goals. Offering
                everything from dance-inspired at-home workouts to HIIT workouts
                just like what you would experience at the gym, these programs
                deliver convenience, affordability and valuable resources, too.

                Although I have always been tall, I have never been known for my
                posture. As early as middle school, one of my basketball and
                volleyball coaches began regularly correcting my posture. She
                would poke me in the back during after-school practices, to
                nudge me into standing up straight.
              </p>
              <p>
                Decades later, not much has changed. Even today, remembering not
                to slouch turns out to be nearly impossible for me. Without
                enlisting my old coach to follow me around, poking me in the
                back, I just can’t remember to pay attention to my posture.

                When I turned to the Internet for help, I found that there are
                dozens of products aimed at helping people like me. Posture
                correctors, whether analog braces worn under clothes or wearable
                devices from startup companies, purport to train you to have a
                more aligned and upright posture. Many also claim to help
                relieve the extremely common ailment of back pain. But do
                posture-correcting devices really do any good?
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, the evidence suggesting that posture correctors have a
                benefit for most people is thin. “Generally, we think of those
                as gimmicks,” says Scott Beadnell, DPT, a physical therapist
                with Oregon Health & Science University. He says in his 13 years
                of practicing as a physical therapist, he’s never recommended
                such a device to a patient.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, some individuals may find they help in some way or
                enjoy using them. But even so, achieving one “correct” posture
                might not even be completely necessary when it comes to keeping
                yourself comfortable and pain-free at work. A more important
                goal, the experts we spoke with say: movement, and variety.

              <h2>What Are Posture Correctors?</h2>
              <p>
                Most posture-correcting devices tend to be some variation on a
                brace, bra, or shirt that’s meant to pull your shoulders, neck,
                and back into a more straightened-up alignment. These may claim
                to retrain your muscle memory, to help you feel more energized,
                or to relieve pain caused by bad posture. Some even say they can
                help with spinal conditions like scoliosis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another group of posture correctors are wearable electronic
                devices that detect non-upright posture and use some form of
                biofeedback—generally vibration—to remind you to straighten up.
                Probably the most well-known brand in this category is the
                Upright Go, which you can attach to your back with either skin
                tape or a necklace. You can also find knock-offs of the Upright
                Go online.

              <h2>Is There Any Evidence Posture Correctors Work?</h2>
              <p>
                Not a lot.
                <a>
                  One 2019 review, published in the Scandinavian Journal of Pain </a
                >, collected results from six studies that assessed
                posture-correcting shirts. The researchers found evidence that
                suggests that posture-correcting shirts do change a person’s
                posture, and might help alleviate pain and discomfort, and even
                increase energy levels and productivity. But there were some big
                problems with the studies, says J.P. Caneiro, a physiotherapist
                and research fellow at Curtin University in Perth, Australia,
                and one of the review’s authors.
              </p>
              <p>
                For one thing, the six studies could not adequately assess how
                well posture correctors alleviated pain because they used
                participants who were not in pain. “That’s a major flaw in
                itself,” Canerio says, “because if you’re trying to push
                something that will correct your posture and will give you pain
                relief and improve your function, you should be including people
                that have those problems in the first place to make sure that
                you’re creating a change.”
              </p>
              <p>
                In general, the scientists determined that the quality of the
                research on posture-correcting shirts was generally low, which
                makes the conclusions of those studies a bit shaky. The
                takeaway? There’s not currently good quality evidence to support
                recommending posture- correcting shirts, Caniero says,
                “especially as a management strategy for musculoskeletal pain.”
              </p>
              <p>
                The evidence is thin when it comes to electronic devices, too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upright, which makes the wearable Upright Go, cites just one
                peer-reviewed study showing a benefit from its device.
                <a>
                  That study, published in 2020 in Applied Psychophysiology and
                  Biofeedback </a
                >, included 26 college students, 13 of whom chose to try out the
                Upright device and 13 of whom didn’t. Those that used it
                reported feeling more energy and less fatigue. But the study,
                which was in a small group of young people, didn’t assess pain
                or employ any objective measurements of posture. (Upright did
                not respond to a request for a comment.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Several experts I spoke with noted that a lack of evidence
                doesn’t mean these devices are proven to be useless for
                everyone—just that scientists haven’t yet been able to show
                they’re helpful for many people.
              </p>
              <p>
                Still, some individuals might benefit. You might find, for
                example, that a posture brace or a wearable provides a helpful
                reminder to try and keep your spine in a neutral position while
                you’re working at your desk, says Mayur Jivanjee, a
                musculoskeletal and vestibular physiotherapist based in
                Melbourne, Australia.

              <h2>Are Posture Correctors Recommended for Anyone?</h2>
              <p>
                According to the research, yes: There is one area in which
                posture-correcting braces are well-supported by evidence, and
                that is in children who have the spinal curvature condition
                scolios
              </p>
              <p>
                For kids who are still growing, whose spines aren’t fully
                mature, there’s solid evidence that using a corrective brace can
                help reduce the risk of spinal curvature getting worse,
                <a>according to the Scoliosis Research Society</a>. Generally,
                people work with medical professionals to find the right type
                and fit for such a brace. (They’re not necessarily the same ones
                consumers can get readily online.)
              </p>
              <p>
                Once a person has stopped growing, however, bracing is no longer
                recommended as a treatment for scoliosis, since it won’t stop
                spinal curvature from getting worse, according to Wolters
                Kluwer’s UpToDate, a decisionmaking tool for physicians.

                Are There Potential Downsides to Trying a Posture Corrector?
              </h2>
              <p>
                Yes. The cost of these devices is one, of course. You might be
                spending money without much guarantee of benefit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, Jivanjee notes it’s possible that a brace might
                encourage extremes of position, which is why he wouldn’t
                recommend wearing one all day or even for more than an hour or
                two at a time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eugene Wai, MD, a spine surgeon and associate professor in
                orthopedic surgery at the University of Ottawa, worries about
                another type of harm, at least with respect to physical posture
                braces. For people struggling with back pain, muscle weakness
                and strain may be a more relevant problem than simply their
                posture. With a brace, Wai says, “The danger is that people
                would maybe develop dependence on it, and then actually that
                might lead to worsening of the weakness.” More weakness, he
                says, might exacerbate the back pain, rather than help.

              <h2>Does Bad Posture Cause Back Pain?</h2>
              <p>
                This is an important question behind some of the promise of
                posture correctors, and the answer is that no one knows for
                sure.
              </p>
              <p>
                “I don’t think we have good evidence about bad posture leading
                to chronic back pain,” Wai says. He co-authored
                <a>a 2010 study in The Spine Journal</a> that reviewed existing
                studies on workers who must adopt awkward postures at work (an
                example: sewer cleaners in Denmark who had to hunch over to work
                in narrow sewer tunnels). The researchers found little evidence
                to back up the idea that awkward postures cause back pain.
              </p>
              <p>
                But other analyses—also synthesizing existing studies—have found
                the opposite. For example,
                <a>a 2012 analysis in the American Journal of Public Health</a>
                did find that people whose work required nonneutral back
                postures (along with other types of exertion, like lifting) were
                more likely to experience low back pain.
              </p>
              <p>
                In
                <a>2020, researchers writing in the Journal of Biomechanics</a>
                attempted to pull together the results from multiple analyses of
                the evidence on posture and physical exertion. The takeaway? The
                conflicting findings mean that, currently, there’s no consensus
                about the extent to which postures and other physical factors
                (sitting, standing, lifting, bending, twisting, and more)
                contribute to the development of back pain.
              </p>
              <p>
                <a>Back pain</a> itself is complicated and not fully understood,
                notes Dino Samartzis, DSc, an associate professor in the
                department of orthopedic surgery at Rush University Medical
                Center in Chicago. He points out that recent evidence shows
                factors like genetics, demographics, socioeconomics, and even
                the microbiome can also potentially influence a person’s risk of
                developing a pain problem.

              <h2>What to Do to Protect Your Back</h2>
              <p>
                Chilling out about having perfect posture doesn’t mean tossing
                out all the principles of, for instance,
                <a>sitting well at work</a>. I checked in with Paul Ritchey,
                DrPH, one of Consumer Reports’ in-house ergonomics experts, for
                clarity. He agreed that there’s likely no one perfect posture
                for everyone. But there are still things you can do to help
                avoid soreness, strain, and discomfort in your back when you’re
                working.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Make your workspace more ergonomic.</strong>
                Ritchey suggests setting up your workspace to ensure you can
                keep your back—and your other joints as well—in neutral
                positions, or rather, neutral zones (since, again, there’s no
                exact position that means you’ve achieved a perfect posture).
              </p>
              <p>
                The advantage of allowing your back to assume its natural
                S-shaped curve is that this puts the least stress on your
                joints, intervertebral discs (the soft, flexible material in
                between your spinal bones), and muscles, and helps you avoid
                fatigue. This isn’t the same as simple advice to “sit up
                straight.” For example, ergonomists usually recommend using a
                quality office chair that’s adjusted for your body and sitting
                with a slight recline to help support your back in a neutral
                posture, rather than relying on your trunk muscles alone.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Pay attention to your comfort.</strong>
                Ritchey recommends trying to be mindful of how your body is
                feeling, whatever position you’re in. “In the office and in your
                daily life, like when using a smartphone, it’s easy to shrug off
                a nagging discomfort,” he says. But it’s best not to ignore
                those little aches or pains, and instead try and find a way to
                make yourself feel more comfortable.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Don’t stay in one position all day. </strong>
                All the experts I spoke with emphasized that more important than
                hitting one proper posture is making sure you move around
                frequently and change things up throughout the day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moving around helps nourish your body. It gets your blood
                flowing, sending nutrients to your muscles and the discs of your
                spine, Ritchey says. A key tenet of ergonomics is that whatever
                position you’ve set yourself up to work in, you should try to
                get up, stretch, and move around, even for a minute or two,
                multiple times throughout the day—ideally every 30 minutes.
              </p>
              <p>
                This can also help if you’re experiencing pain that you’re
                worried about aggravating, says Caneiro. “There is evidence that
                people with persistent pain are more rigid and moving less,” he
                says, but freezing up and making yourself more rigid can be
                counterproductive. “There is evidence that taking that approach
                of relaxed movement actually provides people with reduction in
                pain and improvement in function.”
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Know when to call in a professional.</strong>
                If you’re experiencing chronic pain, it’s best to visit a
                provider who can help you figure out what might be causing your
                pain and what you can do to address it. The solution is likely
                going to be more nuanced than the oversimplified promise of a
                posture-correcting device, Beadnell says.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Exercise regularly. </strong>
                The muscles of your core and trunk help support your back, so
                it’s important to keep them in good condition. Although you
                might think that means you need to do crunches every day,
                there’s actually a wide variety of exercises that will help,
                says Wai. “Almost any form of upright exercise will also work at
                strengthening the core as well.”

                  As a science journalist, my goal is to empower consumers to
                  make informed decisions about health products, practices, and
                  treatments. I aim to investigate what works, what doesn't, and
                  what may be causing actual harm when it comes to people's
                  health. As a civilian, my passions include science fiction,
                  running, Queens, and my cat. Follow me on Twitter:
